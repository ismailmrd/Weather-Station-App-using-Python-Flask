# Weather-Station-python-flask-project

In this project I developed a software platform for agrometeorological stations, which
provides several data measurements and information on several meteorological parameters
such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and speed and direction of the wind...
These stations record weather information on a database. The access to these data is
via a web platform that I developed by Python and its framework Flask.
